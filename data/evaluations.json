He pitches in where we need help and bridges the gap to keeping things going at FITGMR.)\n• Build Trust: 4-Exceeds Expectations (Client FB reports trust as #1 best thing about working with Asiri: \"Trust. I know what Asiri says he is going to do - he will do.\")\n• Resilient Under Stress:  (FB didn't address resilience.)\n• Team Player: 4-Exceeds Expectations (FB from client: Excellent. There are a couple of people at FITGMR that Asiri collaborates with and he does this very well. Ideating, co-coding, building. There are also times when Asiri needs to collaborate with our partners, most of whom are start-ups as well and their tech staff. I am always confident putting Asiri in touch with other companies tech teachs to problem solve.  )\n• Move Fast: 3-Meets Expectations (No explicit evidence of 'moving fast' but enough positive FB to ascertain and appreciated pace that is adaptable to various kinds of work.)",

Even when tackling isolated, complex problems over several weeks, his team fully trusts that he’s doing what’s needed. His positivity and integrity reinforce that trust.)\n• Resilient Under Stress: 4-Exceeds Expectations (Despite parenting a newborn, dealing with shifting project expectations, and supporting teammates under pressure, Igor remains calm, optimistic, and focused. He openly acknowledges anxiety and works actively through it—via therapy, coaching, and mindset shifts. He brings emotional steadiness to his team, even during uncertainty (e.g., contract renewal limbo).)\n• Team Player: 4-Exceeds Expectations (Igor is repeatedly described as generous, positive, and always ready to help. He supports his peers, pairs effectively, adapts to team needs, and stays engaged across disciplines. His blend of technical contribution and relational warmth makes him a central team pillar.\nSummary: Supportive, collaborative, and highly engaged.)\n• Move Fast: 3-Meets Expectations (Igor executes quickly and precisely, even while balancing caregiving and distributed teams. However, one area for growth is speaking up more assertively when he sees a potential problem. He sometimes holds back on technical concerns (e.g., Terraform to CDK switch) to avoid friction, even when he has valid insights. He’s actively working on this through leadership training.)",

Journal feedback confirms that his manager is happy with his reliability and encourages him to continue as he is. He anticipates potential issues and shares them early in channels, helping avoid unnecessary PR back-and-forth. While dependable and trusted, he is not yet seen as the primary contact for critical responsibilities.)\n• Resilient Under Stress: 3-Meets Expectations (Gabriel reports feeling calmer and more balanced in this project compared to his previous stressful one. He adapts well to challenges such as messy design processes or nitpicky code reviews, handling them without conflict. His perspective and patience allow him to stay engaged and consistent even when structures are imperfect.)\n• Team Player: 3-Meets Expectations (He collaborates steadily, accepts team preferences in reviews, and makes use of weekly syncs to align with his manager. He contributes by flagging potential issues before they escalate and by showing flexibility when disagreements arise. Growth opportunities include becoming more visibly proactive in mentoring or advocating for team-wide improvements.)\n• Move Fast: 3-Meets Expectations (Gabriel executes tasks effectively, delivering refactors and new features at a pace aligned with the project’s deliberate rhythm. He helped bring Android to feature parity with iOS and has already requested to take on future feature work. While efficient, he has not yet built systems or structures to accelerate the team’s overall pace.)",

His resilience is improving, and he is more confident than before, but this remains an area of active development rather than mastery.)\n• Team Player: 4-Exceeds Expectations (Igor contributes meaningfully to both his immediate team and the client relationship. He steps in where needed, provides quick support, and aligns his role with collective success. He is also building shared learning environments with peers (AWS certification group), modeling collaboration and community-mindedness. He represents the team and company well in external settings, embodying both technical competence and relational trust.)\n• Move Fast: 3-Meets Expectations (Igor executes quickly and provides timely support, particularly in infrastructure and cost-saving initiatives that had measurable impact for the client. He balances speed with quality and maintains reliability. While he is efficient, his focus is still on individual execution rather than building systems that elevate team-wide velocity, leaving this as a solid “meets expectations.”)",

    "Summary for Brains Notes": "Fernando Bastos's Rubric Assessment on Oct 24:\n• Tech Mastery: 4-Exceeds Expectations (Descriptor: Go-to resource with proactive optimization capabilities\nEvidence: \"Deep technical knowledge and mastery. Client trusts him to handle complex and important features. Team feels comfortable seeking his help. Proactively optimized architecture from 1-2 background workers to ~50 background jobs with queues and task management. Innovated automatic retry system eliminating manual processes for inventory conflicts and database locks. Successfully evolved from backend specialist to full-stack capabilities, handling complex portfolio graphics with multiple iterations. Daily go-to resource for backend troubleshooting and international ACH technical support.\"\nAssessment Note: Fernando consistently demonstrates Level 4 behaviors: he's the go-to resource for complex problems, proactively optimizes existing systems (architecture expansion, retry automation), and continuously pushes his technical boundaries (backend to full-stack transition). Client trust in assigning critical features and team reliance on his expertise confirm his thought leadership impact.)\n• Build Trust: 3-Meets Expectations (Descriptor: Reliable communicator who consistently delivers\nEvidence: \"Very collaborative and reliable teammate who communicates clearly. Always takes ownership of work. Consistently delivers high-quality work and communicates effectively with both team and client. Proactive approach helps identify and solve potential issues early. Sets great example through consistency, accountability, and collaborative mindset. Team comfortable seeking his support. Client consistently assigns complex features based on trust in his delivery.\"\nGrowth Edge: To reach Level 4, Fernando needs to enhance precision in non-verbal communication (body language, tone of voice as identified by teammates). While communication is clear and effective, strengthening soft skills would elevate his presence. He's approaching Level 4 with his reliability and follow-through, but refining communication precision would complete the picture.)\n• Resilient Under Stress: 4-Exceeds Expectations (Descriptor: Thrives under pressure and adapts smoothly\nEvidence: \"Stays calm and effective under pressure. Handled several urgent tasks smoothly. Successfully navigated multiple iterations of portfolio graphics as requirements shifted. Maintains consistent high-quality delivery even under tight deadlines. Demonstrates professionalism and composure in challenging situations.\"\nAssessment Note: Fernando clearly operates at Level 4, consistently thriving (not just maintaining) in high-pressure situations. His ability to handle urgent tasks smoothly and adapt to changing requirements without quality degradation demonstrates he excels in ambiguous environments.)\n• Team Player: 4-Exceeds Expectations (Descriptor: Essential team member with informal mentorship impact\nEvidence: \"Essential and fundamental piece of the team. Having him on the team is essential. Highly valued by the team, his contributions make a real difference. Mentors new team members. Team feels comfortable seeking his help. Always willing to help others. Strong positive impact on overall delivery.\"\nGrowth Edge: Continue with his leadership and mentorship approach. He already advocates for the team through his reliability and support, mentors informally, and team depends on him as essential. )\n• Move Fast: 4-Exceeds Expectations (Descriptor: Creates systems enabling team efficiency\nEvidence: \"He's the kind of person you really want on your team. If you need something done, give it to him, he'll get it done! Executes tasks efficiently while maintaining quality. Created automatic retry system eliminating manual workflows for entire team. Built architecture infrastructure (50+ background jobs) that became foundation for current operations. Proactively removes blockers. Maintains consistently high speed across both backend and frontend work.\"\nAssessment Note: Fernando demonstrates clear Level 4 performance by creating systems and structures that enable efficiency not just for himself but for the entire team.

Despite juggling new fatherhood, travel preparation, and staying up late trying to organize calendar systems, he maintained his optimistic attitude and continued showing up to meetings (even if late).)\n• Team Player: 2-Progressing (While team feedback acknowledged his exceptional attitude and desire to create positive energy, his chronic lateness to meetings directly disrespects teammates' time and disrupts collaborative work. He admitted preferring others to initiate interactions with new teammates Patrick and Marty, forcing them to carry the relationship-building burden rather than pulling his weight as a consultant-level contributor. Showing up late with non-functioning equipment (audio issues in client meeting) creates additional work for the team and signals he hasn't adequately prepared.)\n• Move Fast: 2-Progressing (Team feedback noted he \"accommodates deadlines and makes things happen\" when actively engaged, demonstrating capability for speed when pulled in. However, he explicitly admitted preferring to wait for others to initiate interactions, particularly with new teammates Patrick and Marty on his current project—limiting his ability to move quickly on ambiguous or emerging needs. His natural shyness in new team environments means he waits to build confidence before becoming fully engaged, creating a lag in his effectiveness. )",

Discuss and plan changes before implementation to build trust through predictability and consistency with team and stakeholders.)\n• Resilient Under Stress: 3-Meets Expectations (Descriptor: Meets Expectations - Processing Challenges Professionally\nEvidence: Managing grief and emotional stress while maintaining professional composure and work quality. Actively processing difficult emotions through journaling rather than avoiding them. Seeking support through therapy and coaching. Client feedback shows continued strong technical contributions during this personal period.\nGrowth Edge: Apply emotional processing skills (acceptance, seeking support, articulating needs) to professional challenges like stakeholder pushback or technical disagreements. Continue developing coping strategies for managing emotional waves while maintaining consistent work engagement.)\n• Team Player: 3-Meets Expectations (Descriptor: Progressing - Strong Technical Collaboration, Growing Strategic Influence\nEvidence: Client feedback shows strong collaboration in PR reviews and technical discussions, cares about team code quality standards. However, launching technical initiatives without team visibility creates unintended collaboration gaps.\nGrowth Edge: Push back more on PO decisions when there's strong technical rationale (per client feedback). Advocate for team needs by suggesting simpler alternatives, highlighting tech debt priorities, and pointing out risks. Move from individual contributor excellence to strategic team advocate who shapes better outcomes through technical influence)\n• Move Fast: 3-Meets Expectations (Descriptor: Meets Expectations - Proactive Executor\nEvidence: Takes initiative on tech initiatives and refactors, demonstrates proactive problem-solving. Client feedback: \"I love that you take the lead on these\" and \"Thanks for your enthusiasm and hard work.\"\nGrowth Edge: Balance speed with visibility and consistency.

Weighs team impact when choosing solutions. Respects boundaries while ensuring team needs are met.)\n• Resilient Under Stress: 4-Exceeds Expectations (Stayed composed and delivered during Okta disruption. Adapted quickly, rebuilding from scratch. Self-aware about communication and improving. Stayed engaged despite slow vendor responses.)\n• Team Player: 3-Meets Expectations (Communicated crisis and shared progress updates. Chose pragmatic workaround to keep team moving. Considers impact across roles, but emotionally challenged by hierarchy. Balances escalation with proper channels.)\n• Move Fast: 4-Exceeds Expectations (Unblocked team by rebuilding auth in 1.5 days. Identified scope and implemented pragmatic fixes fast. Managed users across four Okta instances efficiently. Balanced speed with proper purchasing escalation. )",
